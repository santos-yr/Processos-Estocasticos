This repository was developed with the aim of meeting the evaluation criteria of the Probability and Stochastic Processes discipline of the Postgraduate Program in Electrical Engineering (PPEE) at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF).


## **Principais Comandos Utilizados**

### NumPy
*NumPy is a Python library is an open-source library used mainly for numerical computation. It provides support for multidimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a variety of mathematical functions for working with these data structures.*

### commands

~~~Python
numpy.mean() #Returns the average of the array elements. 
~~~
~~~Python
numpy.median() #Returns the median of the array elements.
~~~
~~~Python
numpy.random() #Implements pseudo-random number generators.
~~~
~~~Python
numpy.std() #Compute the standard deviation along the specified axis.
~~~
~~~Python
numpy.var() #Compute the variance along the specified axis.
~~~
~~~Python
numpy.corrcoef() #Return Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients.
~~~
